# Stopwatch Website
This website was created to function as a stopwatch. It's a simple website that was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website focuses on UI's contrasting visuals, clean design and resposiveness. The colours and shapes were selected for a satisfiying asthetic and JavaScript was used to start, stop and reset the timer.
